# zsh-startify

**TODO: Insert demo.**

This is a start screen for zsh. After starting a terminal session, it will load `tmux` and show you sessions you can attach to. It will also give you the option to create a new named sesion, as well as launch a regular `zsh` session.

## Inspiration

I've used [vim-startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) pretty much every day for the past year. I figured it was time for `zsh` and `tmux` to have a similar tool.
